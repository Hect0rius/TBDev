# TBDev
A Modern take on the original 2010 PHP version, updated to be more up to date.

# Installation
Firstly create a new database called TBDev, with mysql or mariadb, then correct the conifg.php and announce.php with database information.

Then to populate the database upload SQL/tb.sql and then the rest of them in any old way aslong as tb.sql is first.

Upload to your www dir the entire folder, minus SQL, then signup a account and it will make you a sysop :)
